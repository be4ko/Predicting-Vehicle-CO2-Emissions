# Project Description
The project uses linear regression to estimate CO2 emission levels and logistic regression to classify vehicles based on these emissions, offering insights into their environmental impact.

## Features 
- CO2 emission amount prediction with linear regression
- Emission class categorization using logistic regression
- Real-time performance metrics for model accuracy and precision

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-co2-emission-prediction.git
